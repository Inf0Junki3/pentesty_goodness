#simplify_banner_script

This script parses an nmap xml output into something a little easier to use in Excel. As the
script indicates, it makes it easier to batch process nmap scans that have performed banner 
grabs.
The script pre-supposes that you've run something like "nmap -oX [targets] --script http-headers".
It returns an xml file with the address, port, and banner, e.g.:
<banners>
    <banner_entry>
        <addr>127.0.0.1</addr>
        <port>23</port>
        <banner>Welcome to my telnet gateway...</banner>
    </banner_entry>
</banners>
