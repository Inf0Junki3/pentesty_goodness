#pedafy

Deploys peda temporarily to your machine (local or remote), runs gdb with it. This is a nifty trick
more in CTF conditions than pentests, when you have a remote machine that doesn't already have peda
on it.

Prerequisites
-------------

Python 2.7, pwntools, requests

NOTES
-----

This runs gdb as a process (whether local or remote). You will notice that there are some slight
rendering issues. You can run it in standalone or in ipython or in a script.
