#r2_dangerous_functions

Run a check on a binary with radare2, cross-referencing it with a list of dangerous functions.
Because this is radare2 we're talking about, you can use this script not only on linux binaries but
also on ARM binaries (such as Android native libraries).

Prerequisites
-------------

python, pyaml, r2pipe, radare2.

NOTES
-----

This has limited use on a really big binary; my recommendation is to restrict by category when you
have a huge binary.
