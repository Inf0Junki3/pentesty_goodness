#steal_http_headers

Sets up a web server for the sole purpose of leaking a client's HTTP headers. This is useful
for fingerprinting a client, and of course potentially for XSS attacks.

The script could eventually be adapted to have a custom body, headers, test for shellshock... But I
felt that in this instance less is more. If I start using it in social engineering exercises, I'll
adapt it :-D

Prerequisites:
--------------

python 2.7. It is definitely adaptable to 3, without too much trouble.

NOTES:
------

The current version uses serve_forever() which works fine but doesn't clean up the connection - as a
result, when you stop the server you have to wait thirty seconds until it times out. I'll eventually 
get round to cleanly shutting down the connection.
