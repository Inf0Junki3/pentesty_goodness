#decompress_android_backup

Android backups (as created with adb backup) are zlib-compressed archives with some additional 
metadata. If you want to peruse the backup from a computer, you can typically use dd and openssl to
strip off the 24-byte header and then decompress the file. In fact, the Mobile Application
Hacker's Handbook (Wiley ed.) describes this process in the section on Android app hacking.

However, it _does_ require that openssl be compiled with the zlib option. While this is not the end
of the world, spending time hunting down the right version of openssl (or compiling it with the
option) is a pain. So I whipped up a quick python script to do this for me, instead. Enjoy.

Prerequisites: 
--------------

python, with the zlib package.

NOTES: 
------

* This decompresses an android backup (.ab) and converts it into a tar which can easily be opened.

* It works with unencrypted android backups, not with encrypted ones. I will eventually get round to
  making it work with encrypted backups. Maybe. One day.
