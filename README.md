#pentesty_goodness

A repository of scripts that I use for my pentests. Hope that they help someone out there other 
than me :)

Repo is organized with one script (and support files if necessary) per folder.

Index of scripts:

* *activate_wifi_snooping*: This is a quick script to set yourself up for wifi snooping. I use it
during mobile pentests to quickly enable/disable MITM conditions.
