#pentesty_goodness

A repository of scripts that I use for my pentests. Hope that they help someone out there other 
than me :)

Repo is organized with one script (and support files if necessary) per folder.

Index of scripts:

* *activate_wifi_snooping*: This is a quick script to set yourself up for wifi snooping. I use it
  during mobile pentests to quickly enable/disable MITM conditions.

* *decompress_android_backup*: Takes an android backup file created by 'adb backup' (i.e. backup.ab)
  and turn it into a tar that you can peruse.

* *steal_http_headers*: Sets up a web server for the sole purpose of leaking a client's HTTP
headers.
