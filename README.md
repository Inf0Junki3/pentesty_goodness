#pentesty_goodness

A repository of scripts that I use for my pentests. Hope that they help someone out there other 
than me :)

Repo is organized with one script (and support files if necessary) per folder.

Index of scripts:

* *activate_wifi_snooping*: This is a quick script to set yourself up for wifi snooping. I use it
  during mobile pentests to quickly enable/disable MITM conditions.

* *decompress_android_backup*: Takes an android backup file created by 'adb backup' (i.e. backup.ab)
  and turn it into a tar that you can peruse.

* *steal_http_headers*: Sets up a web server for the sole purpose of leaking a client's HTTP
headers.

* *pull_apks_with_su*: This script pulls multiple APK packages from an android phone, using su.

* *set_random_mac*: Sets your MAC address to a randomly selected address in a pool of common OUI's.

* *pedafy*: Pulls peda in local or remote machines, loads it up in gdb for your convenience.

* *r2_dangerous_functions*: Run a check on a binary with radare2, cross-referencing it with a list
  of dangerous functions.

* *byte_distribution*: analyzes the byte distribution of a file.

* *simplify_banner_grab*: This script parses an nmap xml output into something a little easier to 
  use in Excel. As the script indicates, it makes it easier to batch process nmap scans that have 
  performed banner grabs.

* *password_quality_filter*: Filter wordlists down to passwords that would meet basic password
  quality criteria.
