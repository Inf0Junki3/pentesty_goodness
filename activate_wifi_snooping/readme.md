#activate_wifi_snooping

This is a quick script to set yourself up for wifi snooping. I use it during mobile pentests to 
quickly enable/disable MITM conditions.

Prerequisites: 
--------------

ip, sysctl, iptables, dnsmasq, and hostapd. I have provided sample basic config files.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
----------------

* If you do use the basic config files, GO OVER THEM AND CUSTOMIZE AT LEAST THE SSID AND PASSWORD 
  FIRST. They _do_ match up the default interface and gateway arguments for the script, so that's 
  practical.
* I'm not doing any input sanitization here, careful what you put in the config files and what you 
  pass as arguments.
