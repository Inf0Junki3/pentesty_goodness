#xml_fuzzer

This script takes a 'template' XML file and generates fuzzed variants of the file. It strips the
file of line feeds so that the entire XML file is on a single line, which allows us to use the XML
in tools such as Burp Suite.

Prerequisites: 
--------------

BeautifulSoup 4

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
----------------

* This script doesn't handle external entities within the template. Use the flags instead.
* For the time being, the fuzz strings are quite basic. My POC was to fuzz with XXE. I'm planning to
  add fuzzing for UTF, CDATA, SQL and command injection, testing of number ranges and dates.
