#pull_packages_with_su

Ever pentested a mobile app with multiple components? This script pulls packages from a phone with
su, by using tar. It also gets package info and prints it out to screen.

Prerequisites: 
--------------

su (on android device), tar (on android device), drozer, adb, pwntools.

IMPORTANT NOTES: 
----------------

* Be particularly careful about input with this script. It's very heavy on parsing, which makes it
  dodgy with regards to inputs. IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL, THIS COULD CAUSE SERIOUS DAMAGE TO BOTH YOUR
  DEVICE AND YOUR PC. As in, deleting your hard drive.

* Just so we're clear: watch out with this script. If you're *not* careful, this can result in
  command injection. If you don't know what this means, *do not run the script*. Just say no.
